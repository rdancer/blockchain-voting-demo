# Blockchain Voting Demo

A Solidity-based Ethereum project demonstrating a secure and decentralized token voting system

## Executive Summary

**Blockchain Voting Demo** is a demonstration project showcasing a blockchain-based voting system using Ethereum and Solidity. This project serves as a proof of concept for implementing a secure and transparent voting mechanism on the blockchain. It's particularly relevant for organizations looking to integrate blockchain technology for decision-making processes.

### Functionality
- **ERC-20 Token Creation**: Custom tokens representing voting power.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Tokens are used to cast votes on various proposals.
- **Decentralization and Security**: Leveraging blockchain for a transparent and secure voting process.

### Similar Real-Life Use Cases
- **Corporate Governance**: Facilitating shareholder voting in corporate decision-making.
- **Community Decisions**: Enabling decentralized voting in community-driven projects.

## Technical Overview

#### Technology Stack
- **Smart Contract Development**: Solidity
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
- **Testing Framework**: Truffle
- **Deployment and Interface**: Remix

#### Contract Features
- **ERC-20 Token Contract**: Details like token name, symbol, and total supply.
- **Voting Contract**: Mechanics of casting and counting votes.

#### Security Measures
- Best practices to prevent common vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

#### Testing and Deployment
- Testing strategies for smart contracts.
- Instructions for deploying on an Ethereum test network.

#### Interface Description
- Interaction between the user interface and smart contracts.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation Steps
TODO
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/rdancer/blockchain-voting-demo.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up the environment.

### Usage Guide

1. **Ethereum Wallet Setup**:
   - Ensure you have an Ethereum wallet. If not, create one using services like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com).

2. **Acquire Test Tokens**:
   - Open the [Blockchain Voting Demo web interface](https://blockchain-voting.rdancer.org).
   - Click on the “Connect Wallet” button to link your Ethereum wallet with the demo. Approve the connection when prompted by your wallet provider (e.g., MetaMask).
   - After connecting, locate and click the “Request Token” button in the interface.
   - This action will automatically credit a set number of test tokens to your wallet for use in the demo.
   - The token balance will be displayed on the demo interface, confirming the successful transaction.

3. **Viewing Voting Proposals**:
   - Access the list of active proposals on the demo’s main page. Each proposal details what you're voting on.

4. **Casting Your Vote**:
   - Select a proposal to vote on.
   - Choose your stance (e.g., Yes, No, Abstain).
   - Use your tokens to cast the vote. More tokens mean a stronger vote.

5. **Checking Voting Results**:
   - After voting, view the current standings for each proposal.
   - Results are updated in real-time as votes are cast.

6. **Finalizing Votes**:
   - Once the voting period ends, final results are tallied and displayed.
   - Tokens used for voting are reset or returned as per the demo’s configuration.

#### Notes
- This demo runs on Ethereum test networks; no real ETH is required.
- The demo is for showcasing blockchain voting mechanisms; it's not for official or real-world voting purposes.
